                Our application is one of the first of its kind. The application will allow any average joe to be able to explore whichever city theyâ€™re in on a bike, and find points of interest and rest stops along the way.  Whether it be a tourist going for a summer bike ride, a commuter who wants to switch up their route home, or a cyclist who wants to change their training route. It allows riders to see and experience new things such as landmarks, art, restaurants/cafes, and little gems of the city/town.
