## Description
Our application is one of the first of its kind; using GeoJSON, react-leaflet npm and bike path data for the city of Chicago. The application will allow any average joe to be able to explore whichever city theyâ€™re in on a bike, and find points of interest and rest stops along the way.  Whether it be a tourist going for a summer bike ride, a commuter who wants to switch up their route home, or a cyclist who wants to change their training route. It allows riders to see and experience new things such as landmarks, art, restaurants/cafes, and little gems of the city/town.
   

## Installation:
After download the project, run `npm install` in terminal. Do not forget to run it at the same directory which your downloaded folder is. to run the app, in terminal type `npm run seed` and then `npm start`. Also it needs to run mongod in a separate terminal!
